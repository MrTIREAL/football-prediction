# Description
This application, developed using Python and PyQt6, is designed to analyze football match data and predict outcomes using statistical methods. The software currently supports five major leagues: Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga, and Ligue 1. For each league, it covers three seasons: 2024/25, 2023/24, and 2022/23.

## Key Features:
